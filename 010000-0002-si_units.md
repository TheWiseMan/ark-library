The International System of Units, also known as SI or SI system is the most used system of measurement, and the modern generalization of the metric system.

It is a coherent system that defines seven units defined through physical constants for seven quantities:

- the 'second' (s) for time
- the 'meter' (m) for length
- the 'kilogram' (kg) for mass
- the 'ampere' (A) for electric current
- the 'kelvin' (K) for thermodynamic temperature
- the 'mole' (mol) for amount of substance
- the 'candela' (cd) for luminous intensity
