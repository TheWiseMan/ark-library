# The Ark Library (000000-0000)

Welcome to the Ark Library.
The purpose of this library is to index all of human knowledge.

## Purpose of the library

The purpose of this library is to provide raw knowledge data, and to be as understandable as possible, either for humans and machines.

One should not expect beautiful graphics or images here, but rather mathematical functions, definitions, lists...
If an illustration is required, it will be provided as an 'svg' code, or a program to trace it will be given.

## Main Categories

- [[010000-0000-physical_sciences|Physical Sciences]]
- [[020000-0000-life_sciences|Life Sciences]]
- [[030000-0000-formal_sciences|Formal Sciences]]
- [[040000-0000-social_sciences|Social Sciences]]
- [[050000-0000-culture|Culture]]

## Utilization of the Library

Any article in the library is indexed with a unique 10 digit code.
For example, this article has the code [[000000-0000-readme|000000-0000]].
Optionally and most of the time, an article also has a more "human readable" name concatenated after the code.

Each article is categorized with its first 6 digits, with each couple of digit representing a sub-category.
A sub-category is just an informative grouping, as the structure of the library in itself is flat.

## Syntax rules

The symbol ':\=' is forbidden in textual paragraphs, if needed, it can be escaped as follows: ':\\='. The reason for this rule is because it is used in the library as the assignment operator.
